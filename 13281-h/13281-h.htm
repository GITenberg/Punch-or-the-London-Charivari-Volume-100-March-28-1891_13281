            <p>It was a gallant Postmaster that armed him for the

            <p>And, oh, his eyes were gleaming as he summoned his
            array;</p>

            <p>To North and South the message went, to W. and
            E.,</p>

            <p>And where, 'mid piles of ledgers, men make money in

            <p>"Ye tramp the streets by day and night, your hours
            are very long;</p>

            employs,</p>

            <p>Though the papers rave, we care not for their
            chatter and their fuss.</p>

            <p>They must keep at home their messages, or send them
            all through Us.</p>

            <p>And we'll crush these boy-intruders as a mongoose
            crushes snakes.</p>

            <p>But <i>Punch</i> was there, and listened, and his
            angry face grew red,</p>

            <p>Like the tape that RAIKES delights in, and he shook
            his ancient head,</p>

            <p>"RAIKES," he cried, "I doubt your wisdom, and I much
            incline to scorn</p>

            <p>Those who trespass on their neighbour's land, and

            pleasant thing</p>

            <p>To incur a bee's resentment and to suffer from its
            sting:</p>

    <p>SOUND AND SAFE.&mdash;We hear that Mr. W.H. GRIFFITHS is to
    be the new Lessee of the Shaftesbury. Years ago, to the popular
    inquiry, "Who's GRIFFITHS?" there was but one answer, "The Safe
    Man." Good omen for the Shaftesbury.</p>

    <h2>BAR BARRED!</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>A Parliamentary Committee Room. Committee
        sitting at horse-shoe table. Bar crowded at table covered
        with plans, custards, buns, agreements, and ginger-beer.
        Huge plans hanging to walls. View in distance of St.
        Thomas's Hospital. East-West Diddlesex Railway Extension
        Bill under consideration.</i> Expert Witness <i>standing at
        reading-desk under examination</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Junior Counsel</i> (<i>for Promoters</i>). You have told
    us that there is a cutting at Burnt House Mill, coloured red in
    plan&mdash;in your opinion do you think that the road passing;
    by Hoggsborough, coloured green, could be so diverted as to
    avoid the necessity of throwing a bridge over the River Crowe,
    coloured yellow?</p>

    <p><i>Expert Witness</i> (<i>with great deliberation, and
    illustrating his remarks by references to a large plan</i>). In
    my opinion I think the necessity of building a bridge over the
    River Crowe may be avoided by skirting the Swashbuckler Estate,
    and by making a new road that would cross the proposed line by
    a level crossing at Twaddlecomb, and ultimately reach Market
    Goosebury, coloured blue, by following the course of the
    Raisensworth, coloured black.</p>

    <p><i>Junior Counsel</i>. Thank you&mdash;that will do.
    [<i>Sits down.</i></p>

    <p><i>First Cross-Examining Q.C.</i> (<i>suddenly entering from
    another Committee Room, looking for his
    Junior&mdash;aside</i>). Where on earth have we got to?</p>

    <p><i>Chairman of Committee</i>. Is this witness
    cross-examined?</p>

    <p><i>First C.-E. Q.C.</i> Certainly, Sir. Now I think you say
    that it is necessary to make a bridge over the River Crowe,
    coloured red in plan?</p>

    <p><i>Expert Witness</i>. No; I say that if the Swashbuckler
    Estate is skirted, &amp;c., &amp;c. [<i>Repeats the answer he
    has already given.</i></p>

    <p><i>Second Cross-Examining Q.C.</i> (<i>entering hurriedly,
    as his learned brother sits down</i>). One moment, please. Now
    you say that it is absolutely necessary to pass the River
    Crowe, in plan coloured red, by a bridge?</p>

    <p><i>Expert Witness</i>. On the contrary, I say that if the
    Swashbuckler Estate, &amp;c., &amp;c. [<i>Repeats his answer
    for the third time.</i></p>

    <p><i>Third C.-E. Q.C.</i> (<i>entering hurriedly, as his
    predecessor resumes his seat</i>). And now, Sir, that my
    learned friends have asked you <i>their</i> questions, I have
    to ask you <i>mine</i>. Be kind enough to say, for the benefit
    of the Right Hon. Chairman and the Hon. Members of the
    Committee, whether, in your opinion, in the construction of the
    proposed line, where the road reaches the neighbourhood
    of&mdash;(<i>consulting plan</i>)&mdash;Market Goosebury,
    coloured blue in the plan, and, as you will see, runs through
    the&mdash;(<i>inspects plan closely</i>)&mdash;Swashbuckler
    Estate&mdash;yes, the Swashbuckler Estate&mdash;and comes, as
    you will see, if you refer to the chart, near
    Twaddlecomb&mdash;having now sufficiently indicated the
    locality, I repeat, will you be kind enough to say whether, in
    your opinion, the necessity of building a bridge over the River
    Raven&mdash;(<i>is prompted by Junior</i>)&mdash;I should say,
    over the River Crowe&mdash;could be avoided?</p>

    <p><i>Chairman of Committee</i> (<i>interposing</i>). I would
    suggest that, as this question has been answered three times,
    the witness be excused further examination at the hands of
    Counsel not present at the examination-in-chief.</p>

    <p><i>First C.-E. Q.C.</i> (<i>warmly</i>). I consider this an
    infringement of the privileges of the Bar. The Right Hon.
    Chairman must remember that it is possible that a single
    reference in the examination-in-chief may only require
    cross-examination on the part of the Clients whom we represent.
    Besides, an expert witness's examination-in-chief is very
    seldom shaken, and all we can possibly want is a note taken by
    a learned friend who has acted as a Junior. All of us are
    occasionally wanted elsewhere.</p>

    <p><i>Second C.-E. Q.C.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). Yes; and how
    can we attend to our Clients' interests if we are not allowed
    to be in two places at once?</p>

    <p><i>Third C.-E. Q.C.</i> (<i>furiously</i>). You have no
    right to act upon an old ruling that was never enforced. Why,
    such a regulation would ruin us&mdash;and many of us have wives
    and children!</p>

    <p>"IN THE NAME OF THE LAW&mdash;PHOTOGRAPHS!"&mdash;MR. A.
    BRIEFLESS, Junr., having received a respectful invitation from
    some Brook Street Photographers to favour them (without charge)
    with a sitting, "to enable them to complete their series of
    portraits of distinguished legal gentlemen," regrets to say
    that, as he has already sat for another Firm making the same
    request (see <i>Papers from Pump-handle Court</i>), he is
    unable to comply with their courteous request. However, he is
    pleased to hear that a similar petition has been forwarded to
    others of his learned friends, one of whom writes to say, he
    "possesses a wig, and the right to wear it, but that there his
    connection with the Law begins and ends." Mr. A. BRIEFLESS,
    Junr., wishes the industrious Firm every success in their
    public-spirited undertaking.</p>

    <h2>ABOUT THE COURT.</h2>

    <p>At the Royal Court Theatre, which, as I read on the
    illustrated House Programme, is "Licensed by the London County
    Council to the Proprietors, Mrs. JOHN WOOD and Mr. A.
    CHUDLEIGH,"&mdash;is the LORD CHAMBERLAIN out of it in this
    quarter? (how can there be a Court without a Lord
    Chamberlain?), and, "under which king, Bezonian?" Was it in the
    days of <i>The Happy Land?</i>&mdash;but no matter. To resume.
    At the aforesaid Court Theatre is now being performed an
    original Farce, in Three Acts, written by Mr. R.R. LUMLEY. Ah!
    Ah! LUMLEY, this isn't quite up to your other piece, <i>Aunt
    Jack.</i> Mrs. JOHN WOOD is invaluable, and keeps the game
    alive throughout; while ARTHUR CECIL's <i>Duke of
    Donoway</i>&mdash;not a Comedy Duke, but a Duke in farcical
    circumstances&mdash;is excellent. WEEDON GROSSMITH is funny,
    but in make-up, tone of voice, and mannerisms, the part seems
    mixed up with one or two others that he has played, and is very
    far from being in the same category with <i>Aunt Jack's</i>
    crushed Solicitor. BRANDON THOMAS as <i>Captain Roland Gurney,
    R.N.</i>, is very natural. <i>The Office Boy</i> of Master
    WILSON and the little <i>Gridd</i> of Master WESTGATE (very
    near Birchington when the boy is in Mrs. WOOD's hands), are
    capital. Miss CARLOTTA LECLERCQ's <i>Duchess</i> is equal to
    the occasion. The two girls' parts are unnatural and
    uninteresting. What ought to make the success of the piece is
    the scene where WEEDON GROSSMITH volunteers to sing "<i>The
    Wolf</i>," and everyone talks and chatters until the Babel ends
    in an explosion. It convulses the house with laughter; and if
    this situation had been so contrived,&mdash;as it might have
    been, allow me to say,&mdash;as to end the Act, the Curtain
    falling on the climax, the dashing down of the enraged
    musician's song and the exit of the Duke, the run of <i>The
    Volcano</i> would have been insured from now to Christmas. Is
    it too late to retrieve this? To quote the title of one of
    ANTHONY TROLLOPE's novels, "I say No!" There is so much that is
    genuinely funny in the piece, that if the alteration is done
    with a will, <i>hic et nunc</i>, why within a week the piece
    could be fixed securely in its place for the London season, and
    beyond it. Let funny little WEEDON reconsider his make-up, and
    come out as the flaxen-headed M.P. of a Saxon constituency. And
    a word in his ear,&mdash;SOTHERN fashioned <i>Lord
    Dundreary</i> out of a worse part than this. <i>The Volcano</i>
    shouldn't "bust up." That's my opinion, as</p>

    <h3>A SCHOOL OF CRITICISM.</h3>

    <p>From the <i>Queen</i>. A Correspondent writes:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"JOURNALISM.&mdash;I want to become a Dramatic Critic;
        how should I begin? I am fond of going to the theatre, but
        find it difficult to remember the plot of the play
        afterwards. What kind of notices do Editors
        prefer?&mdash;<i>Histrionica</i>."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Isn't it Mr. DAVID ANDERSON who has set up a flourishing
    School for Journalists? Why shouldn't there be a School for
    Critics? The Master would take his pupils to the Theatre
    regularly, and could lecture on the Play as it proceeded.
    Should Managers and Actors be so blind to the best interests of
    their Art as to refuse to allow the play to be stopped from
    time to time to allow of the Instructor's remarks, then he
    would have to wait until after each Act, and retire with his
    pupils into some quiet corner of the Refreshment-room, where he
    could give his lecture. Or teacher and pupils could hear a
    Scene or an Act every night,&mdash;and if they paid for their
    places (a reduction being made for a quantity), the particular
    drama they patronised would be considerably benefited by this
    plan.</p>

    <p>There might be a uniform or an academic costume for these
    critical scholars&mdash;say Shakspearian collars, Undergraduate
    gown, and portable mortar-board, to fold up, and be sat upon.
    There might be a row reserved for them at the back of the Dress
    Circle, and twenty-five per cent. reduction on tickets for a
    series. The M.C., or Master of Critics, would take a fee for a
    course from each pupil. Fee to include seat at theatre,
    instruction, <i>and supper afterwards</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE UNIVERSAL
    LANGUAGE,&mdash;"Hallo!" being the recognised telephonic
    summons in use between companies and individuals of all
    nationalities, may be already considered as "Hallo'd by a
    variety of associations."</p>

    <p><i>Rebecca</i>. Good morning, dear. (<i>A moment

    this morning? There's something about <i>you</i> in it.</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. Oh, indeed? (<i>Puts down hat and stick, and
    takes up paper.</i>) H'm! (<i>Reads&mdash;then walks about the
    room.</i>) KROLL <i>has</i> made it hot for me. (<i>Reads some
    more.</i>) Oh, this is <i>too</i> bad! REBECCA, they <i>do</i>
    say such nasty spiteful things! They actually call me a
    renegade&mdash;and I can't <i>think</i> why! They
    <i>mustn't</i> go on like this. All that is good in human
    nature will go to ruin if they're allowed to attack an
    excellent man like me! Only think, if I can make them see how
    unkind they have been!</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> Yes, dear, in that you have a great and glorious
    object to attain&mdash;and I wish you may get it!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. Thanks. I think I shall. (<i>Happens to look
    through window, and jumps.</i>) Ah, no, I shan't&mdash;never

    <p><i>Reb.</i> <i>Not</i> the White Horse, dear? We must really
    not overdo that White Horse!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. No&mdash;the mill-race, where
    BEATA&mdash;(<i>Puts on his hat&mdash;takes it off again.</i>)
    I'm beginning to be haunted by&mdash;no, I <i>don't</i> mean
    the horse&mdash;by a terrible suspicion that BEATA may have
    been right after all! Yes, I do believe, now I come to think of
    it, that I must really have been in love with you from the
    first. Tell me <i>your</i> opinion.</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>struggling with herself, and still
    crocheting.</i>) Oh&mdash;I can't exactly say&mdash;such an odd
    question to ask me!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>shakes his head</i>). Perhaps; I have no
    sense of humour&mdash;no respectable Norwegian
    <i>has</i>&mdash;and I <i>do</i> want to know&mdash;because,
    you see, if I <i>was</i> in love with you, it was a <i>sin</i>,
    and if I once convinced myself of that&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Wanders across the room.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>breaking out</i>). Oh, these old ancestral
    prejudices! Here is your hat, and your stick, too; go and take
    a walk.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[ROSMER <i>takes hat and stick, first, then goes out and
        takes a walk; presently</i> Madam HELSETH <i>appears, and
        tells</i> REBECCA <i>something</i>. REBECCA <i>tells</i>
        her <i>something. They whisper together</i>. Madam H.
        <i>nods, and shows in</i> Rector KROLL, <i>who keeps his
        hat in his hand, and sits on a chair.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Kroll</i>. I merely called for the purpose of informing
    you that I consider you an artful and designing person, but
    that, on the whole, considering your birth and moral
    antecedents, you know&mdash;(<i>nods at her</i>)&mdash;it is
    not surprising. (REBECCA <i>walks about, wringing her
    hands</i>) Why, what <i>is</i> the matter? Did you really not
    know that you had no right to your father's name? I'd no
    <i>idea</i> you would mind my mentioning such a trifle!</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>breaking out</i>). I <i>do</i> mind. I am an
    emancipated enigma, but I retain a few little prejudices still.
    I <i>don't</i> like owning to my real age, and I <i>do</i>
    prefer to be legitimate. And, after your information&mdash;of
    which I was quite ignorant, as my mother, the late Mrs. GAMVIK,
    never <i>once</i> alluded to it&mdash;I feel I must confess
    everything. Strong-minded advanced women are like that. Here is
    ROSMER. (ROSMER <i>enters with his hat and stick.</i>) ROSMER,
    I want to tell you and Rector KROLL a little story. Let us sit
    down, dear, all three of us. (<i>They sit down, mechanically,
    on chairs.</i>) A long time ago, before the play
    began&mdash;(<i>in a voice scarcely audible</i>)&mdash;in
    Ibsenite dramas, all the interesting things somehow <i>do</i>
    happen before the play begins&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. But, REBECCA, I <i>know</i> all this.
    KROLL&mdash;(<i>looks hard at her</i>). Perhaps I had better
    go?</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> No&mdash;I will be short&mdash;this was it. I
    wanted to take my share in the life of the New Era, and march
    onward with ROSMER. There was one dismal, insurmountable
    barrier&mdash;(<i>to</i> ROSMER, <i>who nods
    gravely</i>)&mdash;BEATA! I understood where your deliverance
    lay&mdash;and I acted. <i>I</i> drove BEATA into the mill-race
    ... There!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>after a short silence</i>). H'm! Well,
    KROLL&mdash;(<i>takes up his hat</i>)&mdash;if you're thinking
    of walking home, I'll go too. I'm going to be orthodox once
    more&mdash;after <i>this</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Kroll</i> (<i>severely and impressively, to</i> REB.). A
    nice sort of young woman <i>you</i> are! [<i>Both go out
    hastily, without looking at</i> REB.</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>speaks to herself, under her breath</i>).
    Now I <i>have</i> done it. I wonder <i>why</i>. (<i>Pulls
    bell-rope.</i>) Madam HELSETH, I have just had a glimpse of two
    rushing White Horses. Bring down my hair-trunk.</p>

    <h4>ACT IV.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Late evening</i>. REBECCA WEST <i>stands by a lighted
        lamp, with a shade over it, packing sandwiches, &amp;c., in
        a reticule, with a faint smile. The antimacassar is on the
        sofa. Enter</i> ROSMER.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>seeing the sandwiches, &amp;c.</i>).
    Sandwiches? Then you <i>are</i> going I Why, on earth,&mdash;I
    <i>can't</i> understand!</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> Dear, you never <i>can</i>. Rosmershölm is too
    much for me. But how did you get on with KROLL?</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. We have made it up. He has convinced me that
    the work of ennobling men was several sizes too large for
    me&mdash;so I am going to let it alone&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>with her faint smile</i>). There I almost
    think, dear, that you are wise.</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>as if annoyed</i>). What, so <i>you</i>
    don't believe in me either, REBECCA&mdash;you never <i>did!
    [Sits listlessly on chair.</i></p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> Not much, dear, when you are left to
    yourself&mdash;but I've another confession to make.</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. What, <i>another</i>? I really can't stand
    any more confessions just now!</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>sitting close to him</i>). It is only a
    little one. I bullied BEATA into the mill-race&mdash;because of
    a wild uncontrollable&mdash; (ROSMER <i>moves uneasily.</i>)
    Sit still, dear&mdash;uncontrollable fancy&mdash;for
    <i>you</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>goes and sits on sofa</i>). Oh, my
    goodness, REBECCA&mdash;you <i>mustn't</i>, you know!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He jumps up and down as if embarrassed.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> Don't be alarmed, dear, it is all over now.
    After living alone with you in solitude, when you showed me all
    your thoughts without reserve,&mdash;little by little, somehow
    the fancy passed off. I caught the ROSMER view of life badly,
    and dulness descended on my soul as an extinguisher upon one of
    our Northern dips. The ROSMER view of life is ennobling,
    very&mdash;but hardly lively. And I've more yet to tell
    you.</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>turning it off</i>). Isn't that enough for
    one evening P</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>almost voiceless</i>). No, dear. I have a
    Past&mdash;<i>behind</i> me!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. <i>Behind</i> you? How strange. I had an idea
    of that sort already. (<i>Starts, as if in fear.</i>) A joke!
    (<i>Sadly.</i>) Ah, no&mdash;<i>no</i>, I must not give way to
    <i>that</i>! Never mind the Past, REBECCA; I once thought that
    I had made the grand discovery that, if one is only virtuous,
    one will be happy. I see now it was too daring, too
    original&mdash;an immature dream. What bothers me is that I
    can't&mdash;somehow I <i>can't</i>&mdash;believe entirely in
    you&mdash;I am not even sure that I <i>have</i> ennobled you so
    very much&mdash;<i>isn't</i> it terrible?</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>wringing her hands</i>). Oh, this killing
    doubt! (<i>Looks darkly at him.</i>) Is there anything <i>I</i>
    can do to convince you?</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>as if impelled to speak against his
    will</i>). Yes, one thing&mdash;only I'm afraid you wouldn't
    see it in the same light. And yet I must mention it. It is like
    this. I want to recover faith in my mission, in my power to
    ennoble human souls. And, as a logical thinker, this I cannot
    do now, unless&mdash;well, unless you jump into the mill-race,
    too, like BEATA!</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>takes up her antimacassar, with composure,
    and puts it on her head</i>). Anything to oblige you.</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>springs up</i>). What? You really
    <i>will</i>! You are <i>sure</i> you don't mind? Then, REBECCA,
    I will go further. I will even go&mdash;yes&mdash;as far as you
    go yourself!</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>bows her head towards his breast</i>). You
    will see me off? Thanks. Now you are indeed an Ibsenite.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Smiles almost imperceptibly.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>cautiously</i>). I said as far as
    <i>you</i> go. I don't commit myself further than that. Shall
    we go?</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> First tell me this. Are <i>you</i> going with
    <i>me</i>, or am <i>I</i> going with <i>you</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. A subtle psychological point&mdash;but we
    have not time to think it out here. We will discuss it as we go
    along. Come!</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"

    <h2>A GRAND OLD WETTERUN!</h2>

    <p>I ain't bin werry well lately, and, to crown the hole, I was
    cort in the Lizzard, I think, as they called it, on that awful
    Munday nite, and that was pretty nearly a settler for both my
    old bones and my breth, and might ha' bin quite so, if one of
    the werry kindest Members of the old Copperashun as I nos on,
    who had bin a dining with a jolly party on 'em, hadn't kindly
    directed my notise to about a harf bottle-full of werry fine
    old Port, with the remarkabel kind words, "That's just about
    what you wants, Mr. ROBERT, to take you ome safely this most
    orful nite!" And so it were, and I didn't waste a single drop
    on it.</p>

             Strike.

    <p>However, I was obligated to have a good long rest, which I
    took out mostly in sleep; but, jest as I was preparing to set
    out for the "Grand Hotel," in comes my Son; and he says to me,
    "Guvnor," says he&mdash;I notise as he allers calls me Guvnor
    when he wants me to do sumthink&mdash;"I wants you to do me the
    favour to ask <i>Mr. Punch</i> for to do you a favour." "Why,
    what do you mean?" says I. "Why, this is what I means," says
    he. "About the grandest feller as ewer in the hole world gave
    up fifty years of his useful life to trying to make hundreds of
    stupid boys into clever boys, and hundreds of bad boys into
    good boys, and hundreds of dull boys into witty boys, is a
    going for to have a testymonial given him by sum of them
    hundreds of boys, me among 'em, to sellybrate his Jewbilly,
    same as the QUEEN had the other day. Ewery one of us as lives
    in London will jump at the chance; but the boys as he turns out
    from the great City of Lundon Skool is such reel fust-raters,
    that they gits snapped up direckly by Merchants and peeple, and
    sent all over the werld for to manidge their warious
    buzzinesses there, so we don't know how to get at 'em; but as
    <i>Mr. Punch</i> goes wherever any smart, clever English chap
    goes, if he wood most kindly let this littel matter be
    mentioned, the grandest, and sucksessfullest, ay, and wittiest
    Skool Master of modern times wood get his dew reward."</p>

    <p>So says my Sun, and prowd I was to lissen to his words; and
    this is what I can add to them from my own knowlidg. There's
    sum of the old boys, as isn't quite as yung as when they left
    Skool, as has formed a club to dine together sumtimes, and tork
    of old times, like senserbel fellers as they is; and Mr. JOSEPH

    <h3>THE JOLLY YOUNG WATERMAN.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>Latest Version; suggested by a Case at the London
    Sessions.</i>)</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>And did you not hear of a jolly young Waterman,</p>

            <p class="i2">Who on the river his wherry did ply?</p>

            <p>When rowing along with great skill and
            dexterity,</p>

            <p class="i2">A Cask of Madeira it caught his pleased
            eye.</p>

            <p>It looked so nice, he rowed up steadily,</p>

            <p>Transferred that cask to his boat right readily;</p>

            <p>And he eyed the dear drink with so eager an air,</p>

            <p>For the name on the cask not a jot did he care.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>When smart EDDARD SAILL got that cask in his
            wherry,</p>

            <p class="i2">He cleaned it out&mdash;partly&mdash;with
            swiggings not small,</p>

            <p>And with his companions&mdash;what
            wonder?&mdash;made merry;</p>

            <p class="i2">Madeira's a wine that's not tippled by
            all.</p>

            <p>One fancies one hears 'em a laughing and
            cheering,</p>

            <p>Says EDDARD, "My boys, this is better than
            beering!</p>

            <p>A Waterman's life would be free from all care</p>

            <p>If he often dropped on treasure trove like that
            there."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>And yet but to think now how strangely things
            happen!</p>

            <p class="i2">They copped him for "larceny by
            finding,"&mdash;that's all!</p>

            <p>But SAILL couldn't read, and the jury was
            kindly,</p>

            <p class="i2">So EDDARD got off, though his chance
            appeared small.</p>

            <p>Now would this young Waterman keep out of
            sorrow,</p>

            <p>No derelict casks let him&mdash;shall we say,
            borrow?</p>

            <p>Madeira is nice, but you'd best have a care,</p>

            <p>Before swigging the wine, that it's yours fair and
            square!</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p><i>The Childhood and Youth of Dickens</i>, a sort of short
    postscript to FORSTER's Life, very well got up by its
    publishers HUTCHINSON &amp; Co., will interest those who for
    the third or fourth time are going through a course of
    DICKENS.</p>

    <p>The Baron is an amateur of pocket-books and note-books. The
    best pocket-book <i>must</i> contain a calendar-diary, and as
    little printed matter, and as much space for notes, as
    possible. No pocket-book is perfect without some sort of patent
    pencil, of which the writing-metal, when used on a damp
    surface, will serve as well as do pen and ink on ordinary
    paper. Such a pocket-book with such a pencil the Baron has long
    had in use, the product of JOHN WALKER &amp; Co., of Farringdon
    House. It should be called <i>The Walker Pocket-book, or
    Pedestrian's Companion</i>; for, as "He who runs may read," so,
    with this handy combination, "He who walks may write." The
    Baron is led to mention this <i>à propos</i> of a novelty by
    T.J. SMITH AND DOWNES, called <i>The Self-registering Pocket
    Note-book</i>, a very neat invention, <i>quâ</i> Note-book
    only, but of which only one size has the invaluable patent
    pencil. The ordinary pencil entails carrying a knife, and,
    though this is good for the cutler&mdash;"I know that man, he
    comes from Sheffield"&mdash;yet it is a defect which is a
    constant source of worry to the ordinary note-taker. Otherwise,
    Messrs. SMITH AND DOWNES' artfulness in making the pencil serve
    as a marker, so that the latest note can at once be found, is
    decidedly ingenious, and may probably be found most useful.
    <i>Experientia docet: Baronius tentabit.</i></p>

    <p>While on the subject of pocket-books, the Baron must thank
    Messrs. CASSELL &amp; Co. for the pocket volumes of the
    <i>National Library</i> edited by HENRY MORLEY, and ventures to
    recommend as a real travelling companion, <i>Essays, Civil and
    Moral, by Francis Bacon</i>. In the eighteenth Essay "Of
    Travel," the chief Diarists, "LETTS AND SON," might find a
    motto for <i>their</i> publications. The Baron directs their
    attention to this side of BACON from which this is a
    slice,&mdash;"<i>Let Diaries, therefore, be brought in
    use</i>." A new reading for advertising purposes would change
    "Let" into "Letts," or Letts could be interpolated in brackets.
    "A cheeky way of treating BACON," says the Baron's friend
    little FUNNIMAN (Author of <i>Funniman's Poor Jokes</i>); but,
    if nothing worse than this can be said against the Baron's
    suggestion, why, "Letts adopt it," says</p>

    of the piece or Opera as he might require. Something above the
    price of a Stall to be the maximum charge for one person to
    hear entire Opera. For half the Opera, say six shillings; for a
    quarter of it, three-and-six. For hearing one song in it,
    eighteen-pence; and, if certain songs be in great demand, the
    prices could be raised.</p>

    <h2>COURT COLD!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Page from the Diary of a Chaperon.</i>)</h4>

    <p>They commanded her to rise early. She knew that the day's
    doings would be a terrible ordeal, but she came of a bold and
    sturdy race, and felt herself equal to any emergency. And so as
    the morning broke&mdash;as daylight crept through the foggy
    air&mdash;she prepared for the sacrifice. Yes, sacrifice; for
    was it not a sacrifice to barter away youth, pride, nay, life
    itself! And I had a hand in the matter! Ah, me&mdash;but away
    with vain regret!</p>

    <p>I have been told since that they were hours and hours
    arranging her toilette. So long did it take that she was
    scarcely able to break her fast. She had, I believe, a cup of
    tea, and if rumour is to be credited, a couple of slices of
    thin bread-and-butter! Well, it is over now, and I can think of
    it almost without tears!</p>

    <p>I called for her shortly after noon&mdash;for the lot had
    fallen upon me, and I was destined to attend her to her
    doom&mdash;she was very calm, and even smiled as I kissed her.
    She shivered a little as she sank beside me. I bade her to wrap
    her shawl more closely around her, and after she had complied
    with my command she seemed more at ease.</p>

    <p>And now our conveyance had come to a full stop. We were
    surrounded by a sea of vulgar, hideous faces, grinning and
    mocking at us! My charge clung to me for protection. The
    laughter and the jeers increased tenfold. Then I cast her away
    from me roughly, whereupon followed yells mixed with savage
    laughter. She, poor girl, regained her composure, and gazed at
    the multitude with the dignity of an outraged queen. And
    <i>they</i> laughed the more! Laughed the more!</p>

    <p>At length we were set free, and made our way to a large
    apartment, where we were divested of our wraps, and left in
    costumes better adapted to late June than to early March, or
    mid-December. We were then ordered to advance. We were driven
    from one bitterly cold room to another, until we knew not
    whether the blood was circulating in our veins, or had frozen.
    We had many fellow-sufferers, and these poor creatures pushed
    against us, and fought with us. The great object of everyone
    was to get to the end of our journey!</p>

    <p>She staggered bravely along, until at last they took away
    the yards of satin she carried round her arm, and spread it out
    behind. Then her name was uttered, or, rather, mispronounced.
    She sank on her knees; and, on regaining her feet, was hustled
    away, to follow a number of fellow-victims who had been treated
    with like indignity.</p>

    <p>Once more there was the bitter cold. This time the draughts
    were met in that hall, and endured, until the conveyance
    arrived to move us on&mdash;she to stand for a couple of hours
    amidst gossiping friends, and I to go to bed.</p>

    <p>But the seeds of death were sown! She never recovered the
    shock, and an addition to the inscriptions above the
    family-vault tells of her early decease!</p>

    <p>And who was this poor girl? A homeless one, wandering the
    streets of London? or a political prisoner, on her way to
    Siberia? Neither! She was merely a <i>débutante</i>, attending
    her first (and last) Spring Drawing-room at Buckingham
    Palace!</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March</i> 16.&mdash;House of
    Commons really looked to-night as if it meant fighting. No lack
    of matter for quarrel. Even before public business was reached,
    Orders bristled with Motions raising controversial points. Lord
    CHUNNEL-TANNEL, that man of peace, was to the fore; his Bill,
    extending Manchester. Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway into
    London <i>via</i> Lord's Cricket Ground, down for Second
    Reading. That redoubtable Parliamentary Archer BAUMANN also on
    alert. Has taken under his personal charge the social and
    material welfare of Metropolis; at one time HARRY LAWSON, on
    other side of House, disputed supremacy of position with him.
    But, as SARK says, BAUMANN has immense advantage of making
    Liberal speeches from Conservative side.</p>

    <p>"If," says SARK, "I had to begin my Parliamentary life
    again, I would sit for a Tory borough, and advocate Radical
    notions. If it were possible, I would, with such a programme,
    like to represent one of the Universities, Oxford for choice.
    There's a sameness about fellows who fret up from Liberal
    benches and spout Radicalism, or about men who talk Toryism
    from the Conservative camp. It's what was expected; what the
    House of Commons enjoys is the unexpected. GRANDOLPH knows that
    very well. If he'd come out as a Liberal, he wouldn't have been
    half the power he is. The secret of success in political life,
    my young friend, is to sit in darkness, and clothe yourself
    with light. The thing doesn't hold good in the converse
    direction. A man sitting on Liberal benches, and talking
    Toryism, will gain cheers from other side, but not much else.
    Look at HORSMAN in the past; look at JOKIM in the present.
    Certainly he is CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER; but, even with
    that, I suppose you wouldn't call him a political success?"</p>

    <p>SARK a little prosy and opinionated; otherwise a good
    fellow. Whilst his homily in progress ground considerably
    cleared. Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Bill put oft
    till to-morrow; Kensington Subway Bill withdrawn; BAUMANN
    triumphant. Still remained public business; OLD MORALITY led
    off with proposal to take Tuesdays and Fridays for morning
    sittings and Opposition mustered in great force; Mr. G.
    present, glowing with his own eulogy on ARTEMIS. OLD MORALITY
    moved Resolution with deprecatory deferential manner; only
    desire was to do his duty to QUEEN and Country and meet the
    convenience of Honourable Gentlemen sitting in whatever part of
    the House they might find themselves. Evidently expected
    outburst of indignant refusal, long debate, and a big division.
    Some indignation, but little debate and no division. Everyone
    on Opposition Benches seemed to expect some one else to declare
    himself irreconcilable. When question put, a pause; no one rose
    to continue the successive brief speeches; before you could say
    JAMES FERGUSON, Government had, on this 16th of March,
    practically secured all working time for remainder of
    Session.</p>

    <p>"I feel like CLIVE," said OLD MORALITY; "or was it WARREN
    HASTINGS? Anyhow I am amazed at my own moderation."</p>

        <h4>THE LORDS IN THE COMMONS.</h4>
    </div>

    <p><i>Business done</i>,&mdash;Morning Sittings arranged for
    rest of Session.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;"Lords" and Commons came in conflict
    to-day under novel circumstances. Lord TANNEL-CHUNNEL, pending
    settlement of question about making his Channel Tunnel, is
    promoting new trunk line of railway. Means to bring the
    Manchester, Sheffield and Lincoln line straight into London;
    terminus comes in by Lord's Cricket Ground; invades the sweet
    simplicity of St. John's Wood; artistic population of that
    quarter up in arms; shriek protest in Lord CHUNNEL-TANNEL's
    ear, and shake at him the angry fist. But TANNEL-CHUNNEL not a
    Baron easily turned aside from accomplishment of his projects.
    Squares Committee of "Lords"; impresses into support of his
    scheme representatives of all the big towns on the route;
    Manchester, Nottingham, Leicester, all cheer him on; Liberals,
    Conservatives, Dissentient Liberals, swell his majority. Second
    Reading of Bill carried by more than two to one.</p>

    <p>"How's that, Umpire?" CHUNNEL-TANNEL asked, carrying out his
    bat. "Well played, indeed!" said the SPEAKER.</p>

    <p>Seemed at one time as if blood would flow, and gore would
    stain the floor of House. BARNES and WIGGINS were in it, but
    what it was all about not quite clear. Something to do with a
    coal-truck. As far as could be made out from choked utterances
    of BARNES, there had at some remote period been a coal-truck
    despatched to London by the Midland route. Something happened
    to it; either it was delayed, or it arrived empty, or it didn't
    arrive at all. However, it was quite clear to BARNES that the
    time had come when a new line of railway giving direct access
    to London from the Midlands was an urgent necessity. WIGGINS
    observed to be wriggling in his seat during the BARNES oration.
    Made several attempts to catch SPEAKER's eye; at length
    succeeded; his suppressed fury was terrible to behold: his rage
    Titanic. He at least knew all about that coal-truck; though, as
    far as House was concerned, he did not succeed in lifting the
    mystery in which BARNES had enveloped it. Whether it was
    WIGGINS's coal, or merely WIGGINS's truck; whether WIGGINS
    happened to be in the truck when it went astray; or whether it
    was BARNES that was in it; or whether nothing was in it but the
    coal; or whether, coming back to an earlier point, there was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"
       id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span> no coal in the truck when
       it did (or did not) arrive at St. Pancras: these were
       questions the House vainly pursued, withered, as it was,
       under the wrath of WIGGINS The only point clearly perceived
       was, that BIGGINS is a director of Midland Railway.</p>

             alt="'About that Coal Truck?'" /></a>"About that Coal
             Truck?"
    </div>

    <p>In ordinary circumstances there are not to be found in House
    two more affable men than BARNES and WIGGINS. Amongst many
    other virtues, WIGGINS is, SARK tells me, one of the best
    judges of cigars in House, and is never without a sample in his
    case. It is sad to think that a man so gifted by nature, so
    favoured by fortune, should let his angry passions rise round a
    coal-truck. House, contemplating the episode, glad to shut it
    out by rushing off to Division Lobby. <i>Business
    done</i>.&mdash;Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway
    Bill, Read a Second Time, by 212 Votes to 103.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;House engaged in considering Lords'
    Amendments to Tithes Bill. Things as dull as usual; House
    nearly empty; walk about corridors through tea-room,
    newspaper-room, and library; almost deserted; in smoking-room
    came upon little group playing cards; three of them;
    SOLICITOR-GENERAL, CHABLES RUSSELL, and ASQUITH, LOCKWOOD
    looking on.</p>

    <p>"I suppose," I said, "they're playing whist; why don't you
    make up the hand?"</p>

    <p>"Whisht! it's not whist!" LOCKWOOD whispered, keeping his
    eye closely fixed on game. "It's Baccarat. (Ah! CLARKE! I saw
    you. Come, pay up. You did that very clumsily.) It's the Tranby
    Court case you know. I'm not in it, but my learned brethren
    here hold briefs on either side, and they say they are bound,
    in the interests of their clients, to master the intricacies of
    the game. I must say they have managed very successfully to
    subordinate their horror of gambling. RUSSELL, you know, has a
    positive distaste for any game of chance. But as he says, a
    Barrister must sometimes put his prejudices in his pocket.
    ASQUITH brings to the game a serious aspect that positively
    sanctifies it. As for EDWARD CLARKE, he's wonderfully nimble.
    He was trying <i>la poucette</i> just now when I called out to
    him. As everything turns upon this, my learned friends say they
    must make themselves acquainted with it. But I hope it won't
    lead to any breaking up of families. I'm told the Judges who
    are likely to be trying cases in London before Whitsuntide,
    impelled by a similar sense of duty, are also studying
    Baccarat. The L.C.J. is reported to have developed a wonderful
    talent. As a family man, and Recorder of Sheffield, I'm glad
    I'm not briefed in the case."</p>

    moved Resolution approving the opening for certain hours, and
    under special regulations, of the National Museums and
    Galleries, closed in London to the public on Sundays, made
    capital and convincing speech; supported by men like JOHN
    LUBBOCK, and, from Conservative side, MAYNE and ELCHO. Earlier
    in sitting, the voice of Whitechapel, Hoxton, Shoreditch, and
    Bethnal Green, had been heard by petition, praying for the
    boon. But dear old ROBERT FOWLER knows better what is good for
    the people. Opposed Motion. OLD MORALITY, who never goes into
    his picture gallery at Greenlands after midnight on Saturday,
    whipped up Government forces; Motion lost by 166 against
    39.</p>

    <p>Mr. BUNG, who had been watching Debate from Distinguished
    Strangers' Gallery, hugely delighted. "S'elp me," he said,
    "that'll stop their little game for this Parliament, at least.
    What do they mean hinterfering with honest tradesmen? If you go

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
